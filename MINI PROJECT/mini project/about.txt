This project is based on SMS Spam detection classification with Machine Learning. I will be using the multinomial Naive Bayes implementation.

This particular classifier is suitable for classification with discrete features (such as in our case, word counts for text classification). It takes in integer word counts as its input.

On the other hand Gaussian Naive Bayes is better suited for continuous data as it assumes that the input data has a Gaussian(normal) distribution.
